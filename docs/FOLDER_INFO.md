# Folder Information
This document describes the purpose and structure of key project folders. It provides sufficient context to understand how files are organized while avoiding unnecessary nesting. 

If a folder is not written or mentioned here, it is not important and can be ignored. So keep this updated for development and coding.

The files on root are either entry points or meant to be there.

# assets/
Contains project assets such as static images, GIFs, and other media files.

# docs/
You’re here 🙂 This folder contains all the project’s documentation. No fancy stuff, no external storage — just clear, simple docs written in Markdown or plain text.

# css/
Contains all the css rules and code files.

# sass/ 
Contains all code for Sass, superset of CSS, fancier rules.
